# Release Guide for TL;DW

## Creating a New Release

When you're ready to publish a new version, follow these steps:

### 1. Update Version Numbers

Update version in these files:
- `extension/manifest.json` - `version` field
- `chrome-store-submission/README.md` - update references to version

### 2. Create Extension-Only ZIP

This makes installation easier for users who don't need the full repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/youtube-summarizer
zip -r tldw-extension-only-v1.2.0.zip extension/ -x "*.DS_Store" "**/.DS_Store"
```

Replace `1.2.0` with your actual version number.

### 3. Create GitHub Release

1. Go to https://github.com/ndimoro/youtube-summarizer/releases
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Create a new tag: `v1.2.0` (match your version)
4. Title: `v1.2.0 - Release Name`
5. Description: Add release notes from `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.2.0.md`

### 4. Attach Files

Upload these files to the GitHub release:

**Required:**
- `tldw-extension-only-v1.2.0.zip` - The extension-only package

**Optional:**
- Source code (auto-generated by GitHub)

### 5. Update README Download Links

Make sure README.md points to the latest release:
- Check that the "latest release" link works
- Verify installation instructions are current

## What Users See

When users download from GitHub releases, they'll see:

### Recommended Download (Extension-Only)

### Alternative Download (Full Source)
